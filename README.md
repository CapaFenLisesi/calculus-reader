"Calculus: a Reader" is a textbook for a standard two-semester college calculus course.

## Design goals
First and foremost, this book is designed to be *read*.
That is, it is not meant to be a reference for students doing homework after listening to a lecture.
The class structure that I have in mind is something like this:

1. Students read a section of the textbook and try some exercises before class.
2. Students come to class, perhaps hear a short presentation ("mini-lecture") by the instructor addressing some pitfalls and showing examples, and then work on exercises with peers.
3. Students bring this knowledge to bear on another set of "post-class" exercises to test their mastery and push them towards new ideas.
